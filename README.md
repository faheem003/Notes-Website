# Notes-Website
This is a simple website that uses only python(except for the html that is required). This can be undertaken to get basic knowledge about how everything works in the backend of the website.

The website consists of 4 modules and another one is being developed as we speak. It is  the verify page, where it uses 2fa for email verification to make the project more secure and a little bit more advanced.
